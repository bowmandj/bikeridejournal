# bikeridejournal
A journal to track bicycle rides

This project is under construction!!!

It uses PHP and mySQL, along with some Boostrap and jQuery. It was created using a WAMP server. The PHP is procedural. 

The objectives in creating the Bike Ride Journal are:
- gain experience with PHP and mySQL
- develop an app that I can use to track information on the bike rides that I do

The bike ride journal design.pdf document gives a high-level overview of the application.

The working functionality is:
- Enter and save details for a new bike ride
- Display confirmation page when a new bike ride is saved

Still under construction:
- Search for and edit a previously entered bike ride
- View a confirmation page after saving an edited ride
- View a report listing all rides entered
